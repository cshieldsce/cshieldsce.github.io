# About Me

<div class="about-grid" markdown>

<div class="about-text" markdown>

## Hi, I'm cshieldsce :wave:

I'm a software engineer and security enthusiast. I love building things from scratch, breaking them to understand how they work, and then putting them back together—better.

This portfolio site is where I document my learning journey, share technical articles, and showcase projects I'm proud of.

### What I Work With

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Bash
- **Security:** Web application security, penetration testing, CTF competitions
- **Infrastructure:** Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions, cloud platforms
- **Interests:** Open-source software, automation, and developer tooling

### Background

I've spent years working across software development and security, with a focus on building tools that are both useful and secure. Whether it's writing a parser, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, or auditing a web app for vulnerabilities, I enjoy the challenge.
